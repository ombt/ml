thresholds -

1) DisReadyAve > 15,000 for > 10% of all sampling events for
> 10% of all cuvettes.

2) DisBeginAve > 20,000 for > 20% of all sampling events for 
> 20% of all cuvettes (A- and B-lines of c16000 instruments
are treated separately).

3) DisBeginAve > 20,000 for > 20% of all sampling events for
a total of no more than 4 (c4000) or 7 (c16000, A- and B-lines
are treated separately) cuvettes.

4) data source - instrument results logs and pressure monitoring logs
AbbottLink/IDA

5) notification - instrument serial numbers/cuvette numbers

6) daily (look back at one week of data FIFO only).

7) These include all the c4000 instruments and most of the 
c16000 instruments. On these instruments, currently the sample 
dispense LLS signals in AD counts are reported for four 
time intervals, and they are entitled DisReadyAveV, DisBeginAveV, 
Dis60AveV, and DisEndAveV.
